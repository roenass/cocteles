# A Collection of Cocktails

The '.typ' file is the Source of Truth.  It's a
[Typst](https://github.com/typst/typst) document.
The PDF is simply this document, typeset.

It uses the `in-dexter` package for manual indexing, which is available in
the [Typst Universe](https://typst.app/universe).

## The Collection

The cocktails in this collection are hand-gathered by an erratic process
of chasing rabbitholes. Among of these rabbitholes, one or two deal with
drinking in particular settings in Hollywood's distant past.

Some liberties have been taken, as the document explains; and, obviously,
for many cocktails there are multiple subtle or not so subtle variations,
sometimes vehemently championed by factions well dug-in in that trench on
that hill they've chosen to die on.  Choices have been made, but nothing's
written in stone. Play around.
